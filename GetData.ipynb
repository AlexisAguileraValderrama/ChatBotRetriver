       "'\\nTrigonometry\\nIntroduction to Trigonometry\\nTrigonometry (from Greek trigonon \"triangle\" + metron \"measure\")\\nWant to learn Trigonometry? Here is a quick summary.\\nFollow the links for more, or go to Trigonometry Index\\nTrigonometry ... is all about triangles.\\nTrigonometry helps us find angles and distances, and is used a lot in science, engineering, video games, and more!\\nRight-Angled Triangle\\nThe triangle of most interest is the right-angled triangle. The right angle is shown by the little box in the corner:\\nAnother angle is often labeled θ, and the three sides are then called:\\nAdjacent: adjacent (next to) the angle θ\\nOpposite: opposite the angle θ\\nand the longest side is the Hypotenuse\\nWhy a Right-Angled Triangle?\\nWhy is this triangle so important?\\nImagine we can measure along and up but want to know the direct distance and angle:\\nTrigonometry can find that missing angle and distance.\\nOr maybe we have a distance and angle and need to \"plot the dot\" along and up:\\nQuestions like these are common in engineering, computer animation and more.\\nAnd trigonometry gives the answers!\\nSine, Cosine and Tangent\\nThe main functions in trigonometry are\\nSine, Cosine and Tangent\\nThey are simply one side of a right-angled triangle divided by another.\\nFor any angle \"θ\":\\n(Sine, Cosine and Tangent are often abbreviated to sin, cos and tan.)\\nExample: What is the sine of 35°?\\nUsing this triangle (lengths are only to one decimal place):\\nsin(35°) = OppositeHypotenuse = 2.84.9 = 0.57...\\nThe triangle could be larger, smaller or turned around, but that angle\\nwill always have that ratio.\\nCalculators have sin, cos and tan to help us, so let\\'s see how to use them:\\nExample: How Tall is The Tree?\\nWe can\\'t reach the top of the tree, so\\nwe\\nwalk away and measure an angle (using a protractor) and distance (using a laser):\\nWe know the Hypotenuse\\nAnd we want to know the Opposite\\nSine is the ratio of Opposite / Hypotenuse:\\nsin(45°) =\\nOpposite\\nHypotenuse\\nGet a calculator, type in \"45\", then the \"sin\" key:\\nsin(45°) = 0.7071...\\nWhat does the 0.7071... mean? It is the ratio of the side lengths, so\\nthe Opposite is about 0.7071 times as long as the Hypotenuse.\\nWe can now put 0.7071... in place of sin(45°):\\n0.7071... =\\nOpposite Hypotenuse\\nAnd we also know the hypotenuse is 20:\\n0.7071... =\\nOpposite 20\\nTo solve, first multiply both sides by 20:\\n20 × 0.7071... = Opposite\\nFinally:\\nOpposite = 14.14m (to 2 decimals)\\nWhen you gain more experience you can do it quickly like this:\\nExample: How Tall is The Tree?\\nStart with:sin(45°) =\\nOpposite\\nHypotenuse\\nWe know:0.7071... =\\nOpposite\\n20\\nSwap sides:\\nOpposite\\n20\\n= 0.7071...\\nMultiply both sides by 20: Opposite = 0.7071... × 20\\nCalculate:Opposite = 14.14\\n(to 2 decimals)\\nThe tree is 14.14m tall\\nTry Sin Cos and Tan\\nPlay with this for a while (move the mouse around) and get familiar with values of sine, cosine and tangent for different angles, such as 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°.\\n../algebra/images/circle-triangle.js\\nAlso try 120°, 135°, 180°, 240°, 270° etc, and notice that positions can be positive or negative by the rules of Cartesian coordinates, so the sine, cosine and tangent change between positive and negative also.\\nSo trigonometry is also about circles!\\nUnit Circle\\nWhat you just played with is the Unit Circle.\\nIt is a circle with a radius of 1 with its center at 0.\\nBecause the radius is 1, we can directly measure sine, cosine and tangent.\\nHere we see the sine function being made by the unit circle:\\nimages/circle-sine.js\\nNote: you can\\nsee the nice graphs made by sine, cosine and tangent.\\nDegrees and Radians\\nAngles can be in Degrees or Radians. Here are some examples:\\nAngle\\nDegrees\\nRadians\\nRight Angle\\n90°\\nπ/2\\n__ Straight Angle\\n180°\\nπ\\nFull Rotation\\n360°\\n2π\\nRepeating Pattern\\nBecause the angle is rotating around and around the circle the Sine, Cosine and Tangent functions repeat once every full rotation (see Amplitude, Period, Phase Shift\\nand Frequency).\\nWhen we want to calculate the function for an angle larger than a full rotation of 360° (2π radians) we subtract as many full rotations as needed to bring it back below 360° (2π radians):\\nExample: what is the cosine of 370°?\\n370° is greater than 360° so let us subtract 360°\\n370° − 360° = 10°\\ncos(370°) = cos(10°) = 0.985 (to 3 decimal places)\\nAnd when the angle is less than zero, just add full rotations.\\nExample: what is the sine of −3 radians?\\n−3 is less than 0 so let us add 2π radians\\n−3 + 2π = −3 + 6.283... = 3.283... radians\\nsin(−3) = sin(3.283...) = −0.141 (to 3 decimal places)\\nSolving Triangles\\nTrigonometry is also useful for general triangles, not just right-angled ones .\\nIt helps us in Solving Triangles. \"Solving\" means finding missing sides and angles.\\nExample: Find the Missing Angle \"C\"\\nAngle C can be found using angles of a triangle add to 180°:\\nSo C = 180° − 76° − 34° = 70°\\nWe can also find missing side lengths. The general rule is:\\nWhen we know any 3 of the sides or angles we can find the other 3\\n(except for the three angles case)\\nSee Solving Triangles for more details.\\nOther Functions (Cotangent, Secant, Cosecant)\\nSimilar to Sine, Cosine and Tangent, there are three other trigonometric functions which are made by dividing one side by another:\\nCosecant Function:\\ncsc(θ) =\\nHypotenuse\\xa0/\\xa0Opposite\\nSecant Function:\\nsec(θ) =\\nHypotenuse\\xa0/\\xa0Adjacent\\nCotangent Function:\\ncot(θ) =\\nAdjacent\\xa0/\\xa0Opposite\\nTrigonometric and Triangle Identities\\nAnd as you get better at Trigonometry you can learn these:\\nThe Trigonometric Identities are equations that are true for all right-angled triangles.\\nThe Triangle Identities are equations that are true for all triangles (they don\\'t have to have a right angle).\\nEnjoy becoming a triangle (and circle) expert!\\nTrigonometry Index\\nSine, Cosine and Tangent\\nUnit Circle\\nAlgebra Index\\nCopyright © 2022 Rod Pierce\\n'"

Two factors made Mexico a jewel in the Spanish Empire: the existence of large, hierarchically-organized Mesoamerican populations that rendered tribute and performed obligatory labor and the discovery of vast silver deposits in northern Mexico.[68] The Kingdom of New Spain was created from the remnants of the Aztec empire. The two pillars of Spanish rule were the State and the Roman Catholic Church, both under the authority of the Spanish crown. In 1493 the pope had granted sweeping powers to the Spanish monarchy for its overseas empire, with the proviso that the crown spread Christianity in its new realms. In 1524, King Charles I created the Council of the Indies based in Spain to oversee State power its overseas territories; in New Spain the crown established a high court in Mexico City, the Real Audiencia, and then in 1535 created the Viceroyalty of New Spain. The viceroy was highest official of the State. In the religious sphere, the diocese of Mexico was created in 1530 and elevated to the Archdiocese of Mexico in 1546, with the archbishop as the head of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, overseeing Roman Catholic clergy. Castilian Spanish was the language of rulers. The Catholic faith the only one permitted, with non-Catholics (Jews and Protestants) and Catholics (excluding Indians) holding unorthodox views being subject to the Mexican Inquisition, established in 1571.[69]', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6842164031361734, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '38a6f4e4307192d25f69f6fb0d58b8e'}>,\n",

A ministry for development (Fomento) had been created, but the Liberal revolution of Ayutla swept Santa Anna and his clique away for good. Serious reform seems to have begun around 1870, when the Finance Minister was Matías Romero. Romero was intent on providing Mexico with a modern Treasury, and on ending the hand-to- mouth financing that had mostly characterized the country’s government since Independence, or at least since the mid-1830s.

Finally, there was a small (fewer than 10 percent of all households) but upwardly mobile urban middle class created by economic development under Díaz whose access to political power had been effectively blocked by the regime’s mechanics of political control. Precisely how “revolutionary” were the results of the armed revolt—which persisted largely through the 1910s and peaked in a civil war in 1914-1915—has long been contentious, but is only tangentially relevant as a matter of economic history.

The Viceregal capital Mexico City also administrated the Spanish West Indies (the Caribbean), the Spanish East Indies (that is, the Philippines), and Spanish Florida.

The government hired Guillermo Kahlo (father of painter Frida Kahlo) to create photographic images of Mexico\\'s new industrial structures as well as its pre-Columbian and colonial past. Photographer Hugo Brehme specialized in images of \"picturesque\" Mexico, with images of Mexican places and often rural people.

Agustín Victor Casasola is the most famous of photographer of the revolutionary era, and he collected other photographers\\' images in the Casasola Archive; his vast collection was purchased by the Mexican government and is now part of the government photographic repository, the Fototeca.[412][413] After the revolution, Mexican photographers created photographs as art images.[414] Among others, notable Mexican photographers include Manuel Álvarez Bravo, Héctor García Cobo, and Graciela Iturbide.', 'content_type': 'text', 'score': 0.6723107701670438, 'meta': {}, 'embedding': None, 'id': '76f543fb0f74b76fb871895be646216f'}>,\n",
